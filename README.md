### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carlos, thanks for stopping by!

I'm working on a couple of projects in my spare time, but they are not mature enough (or maybe I'm not! ðŸ˜…) to be hosted on one public repo hereâ€”at least for now. However, I also write for Towards Data Science, so you can read my code there as most of [my articles](https://medium.com/@carlosjuribe/list/an-intelligent-decision-support-system-for-tourism-in-python-b6ba165b4236) are hands-on tutorials where I try to make the transition between reading _prose_ and reading _code_ as pleasant as possible.

### ðŸ”­ What I do and why

I'm a _university-made_ aerospace engineer and a _self-made_ data scientist who switched careers upon graduation, as I realized during my last year of college (mainly by reading [The Master Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm) and [The Singularity is Near](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near)) that **software, data analytics and AI are ubiquitous abstract forces** with a huge potential to transform nearly all areas of live and business. Up to that point, the physics of flight was for me the coolest area where one could apply mathematics, reasoning, and problem-solving. But having discovered AI and the doors to innovation it opened, I could not help but give it a try. It was well worth it. It had all the other intellectual ingredients I was yearning for, plus the missing piece that rocket science didn't require as much: problem-solving through **creativity**. When you write software you need to abide by the rules of logic and arithmetic (and ideally cognitive science!), and that's when you realize that the laws of physics are quite constraining ðŸ˜….

### ðŸ“« How to reach me

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?style=Social&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosjuribe)

LinkedIn is where my read-to-write ratio is much higher than in a code base ðŸ˜Š, although I post some thoughts (and re-post other people's better thoughts) from time to time. It's my **preferred platform** for anyone to reach out to me. Once I have enough confidence in a person, I am happy to share my e-mail or cellphone number. I hope you understand.

[![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-12100E?style=Social&logo=medium&logoColor=white)](https://medium.com/@carlosjuribe)

Medium is where I write blog posts for ideas too long for a LinkedIn post, or **long-form articles** explaining "complex" ideas in "non-complicated" terms, with a hands-on focus so people can **code along when they read along**. I write mainly for [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) on topics like Data Science, Operations Research, Visualization, Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Optimization. All from a Pythonista perspective.
