### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carlos, thanks for stopping by!

I'm a Data Scientist and Operations Researcher with a passion for problem-solving, especially if it involves math, software and big data. I have multiple certifications in [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/carlosjimenezuribe-0135/credentials/afb4054e326b7b5f?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2F) and [Databricks](https://credentials.databricks.com/profile/carlosjuribe/wallet). I like to write **hands-on articles** and tutorials in [Medium](https://medium.com/@carlosjuribe) to teach others what I've learned in the way I would've loved to be taught. I'm a compulsive learner, a Science advocate, and an increasingly-skeptic extropian.

### ðŸ”­ Background

I'm an aerospace engineer and a _self-taught_ data scientist. I started my data science journey right after graduation. I realized during my last year of college (mainly by reading [The Master Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm) and [The Singularity is Near](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near)) that **software, data analytics and AI are ubiquitous technological forces** with a huge potential to transform nearly all areas of live and business. Up to that point, the physics of flight was to me the coolest area to apply mathematics, reasoning, and problem-solving. But having discovered AI and the doors to innovation it opened, I could not help but give it a try. It was well worth it. It had all the other intellectual ingredients I was yearning for, plus the missing piece that rocket science didn't require as much: problem-solving through **creativity**. Since then, I've been marvelled at the "unreasonable effectiveness of algorithms in the business sciences". The fact that it is possible to build intelligent systems that **efficiently automate tasks, accurately predict outcomes, or optimally prescribe actions**, and hence contribute to the betterment of lives, companies and societies is, to me, a miracle. And harnessing the power of that miracle is my mission.

### ðŸ“« Reach out

LinkedIn is where my read-to-write ratio is much higher than in a code base ðŸ˜Š, although I post some thoughts (and re-post other people's better thoughts) from time to time. Feel free to drop me a message there if you'd like to connect.

[![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-12100E?style=Social&logo=medium&logoColor=white)](https://medium.com/@carlosjuribe)

Medium is where I write blog posts for ideas too long for a LinkedIn post, or **long-form articles** explaining "complex" ideas in "non-complicated" terms, with a hands-on focus so people can **code along when they read along**. I write mainly for [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) on topics like Data Science, Operations Research, Visualization, Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Optimization. All from a Pythonista perspective.
